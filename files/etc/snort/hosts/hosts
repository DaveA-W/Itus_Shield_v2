# This template file at /etc/snort/hosts/hosts is used to update system
# /etc/hosts with known mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should be
# placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
# The IP address and host name should be separated one or more spaces.
#
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# /etc/snort/hosts/updatehosts.sh downloads lists of bad domains using
# urls in /etc/snort/hosts/badhostlisturls.txt
# It then replaces the main /etc/hosts with this template,
# appending lines to resolve all bad domains to 127.0.0.1
#
# For example:
#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com    # known server IP
#      127.0.0.1        malware.site      # prevent outbound traffic

# Common loopback names
127.0.0.1 localhost

::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
